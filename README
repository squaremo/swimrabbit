Swim Rabbit swim!

In /: A RabbitMQ plugin that (eventually) will let you upload programs to
run messages through, with an HTTP interface.

Running this: It builds as a RabbitMQ plugin, i.e., when a
subdirectory of rabbitmq-public-umbrella.  It needs a more recent
mochiweb than the one pinned in rabbit_mochiweb. Either use (i.e.,
symlink into plugins/) the one that gets built in
deps/webmachine/webmachine/deps/mochiweb or just a recent clone.

In java/: Some experiments with a transactional JavaScript
interpreter.
